# AdvancedRun Standalone

Run AdvancedRun in correct enviroment and can be integrated in PortableApps Platform.

AdvancedRun is a simple tool for Windows that allows you to run a program with different settings that you choose, including - low or high priority, start directory, main window state (Minimized/Maximized), run the program with different user or permissions, Operating system compatibility settings, and environment variables. You can also save the desired settings into a configuration file and then run the program automatically from command-line with the desired settings.

This is a personal project, not related with NirSoft (https://www.nirsoft.net) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).
This is packed with AdvancedRun 1.51 with correct enviroment select (32 or 64 bit).
